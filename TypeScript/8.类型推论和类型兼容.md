## 类型推论

In TypeScript, there are several places where type inference is used to provide type information when there is no explicit type annotation. 

soundness 安定性


## 类型兼容
The basic rule for TypeScript’s structural type system is that x is compatible with y if y has at least the same members as x. For example:

```
interface Named {
    name: string;
}

let x: Named;
// y's inferred type is { name: string; location: string; }
let y = { name: "Alice", location: "Seattle" };
x = y;
```

recursively 递归


```
let x = () => ({name: "Alice"});
let y = () => ({name: "Alice", location: "Seattle"});

x = y; // OK
y = x; // Error, because x() lacks a location property

```

### 函数参数双向协变 Function Parameter Bivariance #

## Functions with overloads #

Enums are compatible with numbers, and numbers are compatible with enums. Enum values from different enum types are considered incompatible. For example,

```
enum Status { Ready, Waiting };
enum Color { Red, Blue, Green };

let status = Status.Ready;
status = Color.Green;  // Error
```

###  泛型Generics

Because TypeScript is a structural type system, type parameters only affect the resulting type when consumed as part of the type of a member. For example,

```
interface Empty<T> {
}
let x: Empty<number>;
let y: Empty<string>;

x = y;  // OK, because y matches structure of x
```
In the above, x and y are compatible because their structures do not use the type argument in a differentiating way. Changing this example by adding a member to Empty<T> shows how this works:


no params  泛型参数是 any
```
interface NotEmpty<T> {
    data: T;
}
let x: NotEmpty<number>;
let y: NotEmpty<string>;

x = y;  // Error, because x and y are not compatible
```
